## NLP Projects Repository
**This is my personal NLP projects repository. I will try to update this repo frequently**

Main objective is to cover all possible NLP projects. As of now I have covered the following
- [Sentiment analysis using ML models](https://github.com/vineel369/NLP_Projects/blob/master/Disaster_tweets_classification_with_ML_Models.ipynb)
- [Sentiment analysis using Glove emebeddings + ML models](https://github.com/vineel369/NLP_Projects/blob/master/Disaster_tweets_classification_with_Glove_embeddings_ML.ipynb)
- [Sentiment analysis using Glove emebeddings + LSTM](https://github.com/vineel369/NLP_Projects/blob/master/Disaster_tweets_classification_with_glove_emebeddings_LSTM.ipynb)

--> I have used the 300-dim pretrained Glove embeddings to the mentioned problems & I could not able to upload the same as the size of the file is huge (5.25 GB). The same can be downloaded from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
