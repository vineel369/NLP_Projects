## NLP Projects Repository
**This is my personal NLP projects repository. I will try to update this repo frequently**

Main objective is to cover all possible NLP projects. As of now I have covered the following
- Sentiment analysis using ML models
- Sentiment analysis using Glove emebeddings + ML models
- Sentiment analysis using Glove emebeddings + LSTM

--> I have used the 300-dim pretrained Glove embeddings to the mentioned problems & I could not able to upload the same as the size of the file is huge (5.25 GB). The same can be downloaded from [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
